                        <h1>What is a Mardi Gras Indian?</h1>
                        <p><em>"Mardi Gras Indians are secretive because only certain people participated in masking--people with questionable character. In the old day, the Indians were violent. Indians would meet on Mardi Gras; it was a day to settle scores."</em> <strong>- Larry Bannock, Past President, New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council </strong></p>
                        <img src="images/mardi-costume.jpg" alt="Mardi Grass Costume">
                        <p>Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a part of that secrecy as any other carnival organization. Their parade dates, times and routes are never published in advance, although they do tend to gather in the same areas every year.

                            The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the African-American communities of New Orleans's inner city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade is perhaps the least recognized Mardi Gras tradition.</p>
                        <p>Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe often names their parade after a particular Roman or Greek mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras Krewe is a parody of royalty: King, Queen, Dukes, Knights and Captains, or some variation of that theme. Many of the more established krewes allow membership by invitation only.</p>
                        <p>Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate in the typical New Orleans parade. Historically, slavery and racism were at the root of this cultural separation. The black neighborhoods in New Orleans gradually developed their own style of celebrating Mardi Gras. Their krewes are named for imaginary Indian tribes according to the streets of their ward or gang.</p>

                        <p>The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to pay them respect for their assistance in escaping the tyranny of slavery. It was often local Indians who accepted slaves into their society when they made a break for freedom. They have never forgotten this support.</p>
                        <p>Long ago, Mardi Gras was a violent day for many Mardi Gras Indians. It was a day often used to settle scores. The police were often unable to intervene due to the general confusion surrounding Mardi Gras events in the city, when the streets were crowded and everyone was masked. This kept many families away from the "parade," and created much worry and concern for a mothers whose children wanted to join the Indians.</p>

                        <h1>Which krewes have the best throws?</h1>
                        <p>So what are "throws?" Well, they are exactly what they sound like - items that krewe members on floats throw to parade-goers as the floats pass by! Throws often include doubloons, beads, cups, homemade trinkets, toys and more! </p>
                        <img src="images/mardi-gras-throws.jpg" alt="Mardi Gras Throws">
                        <p>The throwing of trinkets to the crowds was started in the early 1870s by the Twelfth Night Revelers, and is a time-honored expectation for young and old alike.

                            In 1884, Rex started using medallions instead of trinkets. These medallions are represented by today's doubloons, aluminum and anodized in many different colors. They depict the parade theme on one side and the Krewe's emblem on the other. They have become collectors items.</p>
                        <p>In the Bacchus parade, the King's float throws doubloons with the image of the celebrity king on one side of the doubloon. If you're lucky enough to catch one, hold onto it!
                            The most prized throws are the krewe's "signature throws." Zulu has it famous coconuts and many other krewes offer hand-decorated items including Muses shoes, Nyx purses, Alla genie lamps, Carrollton shrimp boots and the list goes on. Most krewes have medallion beads that feature that year's theme.
                        </p>
